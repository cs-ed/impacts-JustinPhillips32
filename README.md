# Impacts on Society

Course Name: Intro to Computer Science (jr. high enrichment class)

This class will serve as an introduction to computer science so the students will be able to learn basic concepts and decide if this is a subject they will want to pursue in the future. The course starts with instruction on the basic components of computers and the value of computer science before getting into simple coding using Scratch and Python.


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to analyze the products of computer science to describe the positive and negative effects of the technologies. 

Students will be able to critique the products of computer science to understand ways in which they might be discriminatory based on race, gender, nationality.

Students will be able to describe how society has shaped computer science by providing examples.

### Learning Activities

For the societal impact portion of the Intro to Computer Science class, I will have students work in pairs to show one way in which computing has impacted society. Students will present their findings in a shared Google Slides presentation with links to support their claim. Each group will have to list at least one positive and one negative impact. When finished, we will use the slides to have a classroom discussion about the positive and negative effects each example has had on society. After the discussion, students will individually do a short written assignment that ranks the impacts listed in the Google Slides presentation on how profoundly they affected society with justification. There will be a second class discussion on how some of the negative or positive impacts might be more profound for some members of the global society depending on the country they live in, gender, race, etc. I envision this portion of the class taking four class meetings to complete.

### Assessment

Students will be assessed in two ways. First, the shared Google Slides presentation will be graded based on completion for each group. The second method of assessment will be the short written assignment in which students have to rank the effects of computer science to gauge which ones have had the greatest impact. The written assignment will have an accompanying rubric that grades the studentsâ€™ efforts in critiquing the findings in the Google Slides presentation and their ability to support their arguments.

### Outcomes

The learning activities listed above should ensure that students reach the learning objectives by ensuring that the students are researching the ways in which computer science has impacted society and vice versa. By having students think critically about the effects of computer science on society to rank their influence, students will reach a deeper understanding of how our modern society and computer science are inextricably linked. Having a class discussion about the ways in which computer science affects people differently should lead to fruitful discussions about the ways in which we can make the field of computer science more diverse and inclusive.
